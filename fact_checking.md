# Part 4. Fact Checking

Below are some interesting claims.  For part 4 of the assignment, your task is to investigate  claims.  For each claim, create a file named `fact_check_X.txt` where `X` is replaced with the number of the claim that you are investigating.  Inside this file, please copy and paste the claim, then include your analysis of the claim, including SQL queries that you used to validate the claim.

You must investigate a *minimum* of 4 claims (additional one earn challenge problem credit).  In addition, for full credit, avoid focusing on the claims that are the easiest to verify.  And, as should be obvious, you cannot investigate your own claim.  Finally -- again I hope this is obvious -- you should not consult the authors of the claim for tips on how to evaluate it.


1. Republicans work harder for the country, because while democrats are dilly-dallying
in the Senate and in Congress, Republicans are out there trying to fix our country by
passing more bills! They are more likely to vote yes on legislation, meaning they want
to get more done for the US!

2. More Democrats from Ohio have voted no on abortion subjects than republicans with 73% vs 33%.
